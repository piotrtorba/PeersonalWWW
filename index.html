			<h1>Career Overview</h1>
			<p>At the moment I work in the construction industry in Switzerland however as you review my resume you will see that I have extensive experience as an experienced/skilled product builder in Stryker Neurovascular Cork, Ireland which is well-known player in medical devices industry. I was responsible for manufacturing, monitoring and inspecting products along full manufacturing processes, auditing compliance with the 6S methodology (Sort, Shine, Schedule, Standardize, Sustain, Safety) for dedicated zone, attending quality team meetings and developing constant improvements for audit strategies, writing audit reports to zone manager, training personnel. I have proven myself to be a competent and creative team player with the capacity to manage a number of diverse functions and leader aspirations.<br>My job has required extreme attention to details and organizational skills coupled with a creative approach and problem solving. I have also had the opportunity to develop strong interpersonal and professional communication skills. Everyday work with accordance to cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) and Lean Manufacturing were the key points to uphold high volume manufacturing process and product quality. I also possess the right balance of being friendly and approachable, whilst being able to make those hard decisions needed to keep things moving.<br>I am an open-minded person and recently started an online Web Programming course which can allow me to work as a freelancer in designing websites, however I am still looking for a perfect, long term job in which I could make enough money for my family and have enough time for my IT interests and further self-development.<br>I am a highly motivated employee who is passionate about providing exceptional satisfaction.</p>
